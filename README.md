Week 1-2: Strengthening Core Front-End & JavaScript Concepts

Goal: Master JavaScript, React, and Front-End Performance

Topics to Cover

JavaScript:

Closures, Hoisting, Event Loop, Promises, Async/Await
Prototypes, this keyword, Call, Apply, Bind
Debouncing & Throttling
Functional Programming (map, reduce, filter)

ES6+ Features:

Destructuring, Spread/Rest Operators
Arrow Functions, Template Literals

React (Deep Dive):

Reconciliation, React Fiber, Virtual DOM
State Management: Context API, Redux, Zustand, Recoil
React Hooks (useMemo, useCallback, useEffect optimizations)
Server-Side Rendering (Next.js fundamentals)

Performance Optimization:

Webpack Optimizations (Lazy Loading, Code Splitting, Tree Shaking)
Rendering Optimizations (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
Critical Rendering Path

CSS & UI Principles:

Flexbox, Grid, Tailwind, Emotion
Accessibility (WCAG, ARIA)
Responsive Design (Mobile-first approach)

Practice

âœ… Build a mini React app (e.g., a job board, task manager, or dashboard).
âœ… Solve 5-6 JavaScript/React-based problems on LeetCode daily.

Week 3-4: Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

Goal: Be comfortable with problem-solving under time constraints.

Topics to Cover

Arrays & Strings (Sliding Window, Two Pointers)
Linked Lists (Fast-Slow Pointers, Merging, Reversal)
Stacks & Queues (Monotonic Stack, LRU Cache)
HashMaps & Sets (Frequency Counting, Anagrams, Subarrays)
Recursion & Backtracking (Subsets, Permutations, Sudoku Solver)
Binary Search & Sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Custom Sorting)
Graphs & Trees (BFS, DFS, Trie, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm)
Dynamic Programming (Memoization, Tabulation)

Practice

âœ… Solve 5-6 LeetCode Medium/Hard questions daily (focus on FAANG-like problems).
âœ… Review and implement sorting algorithms from scratch.
âœ… Mock Interviews on Pramp or Interviewing.io

Week 5-6: System Design & Architecture

Goal: Design scalable, performant web applications.

Topics to Cover

System Design Basics:

Load Balancing, Caching (Redis, CDN)
Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
Databases: SQL vs NoSQL (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
API Rate Limiting, Throttling

Frontend Architecture:

Micro Frontends
Component-Driven Development (Storybook)
State Management Patterns (Flux, Redux Saga)

Backend Concepts (if applying for Full Stack roles):

REST API Design & GraphQL
Authentication (OAuth, JWT)
WebSockets, Server Sent Events (Real-time Apps)
Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

Practice

âœ… Design an E-commerce or Social Media App from scratch.
âœ… Mock System Design interviews with peers (use Excalidraw for diagrams).

Week 7-8: Mock Interviews & Behavioral Preparation

Goal: Apply everything you've learned under real interview conditions.

Technical Interview Practice

Live Coding Interviews (LeetCode, CodeSignal, HackerRank)
System Design Mock Interviews (Mock with peers or Interviewing.io)
Debugging & Testing Skills (Write Jest, Cypress tests)
Behavioral Interview Prep (STAR Method)

Common Questions:

"Tell me about a time you faced a challenge..."
"How do you handle disagreements in a team?"
"Describe a complex project you worked on."
"How do you ensure performance optimization in an application?"

Final Sprint

âœ… Apply to target companies.
âœ… Conduct 1-2 mock interviews per week.
âœ… Get feedback & refine weak areas.
