Week 2: React Core & Advanced Concepts

Days 8-9: React Fundamentals & Hooks Mastery 2-3 July

Virtual DOM & Reconciliation: How React updates the UI efficiently, key prop importance.
Component Lifecycle: Understanding useEffect (dependencies array, cleanup functions), useLayoutEffect.
State Management with Hooks: useState, useReducer (when to use each).
Context API: When to use it, avoiding prop drilling, performance considerations.
Practice: Build a component using useState and useEffect. Use useReducer for more complex state.
Mini-Project Idea: Develop a simple counter or toggle component that uses useState and useEffect with proper cleanup to manage side effects. Implement a simple theme switcher using useContext.

Days 10-11: Performance Optimization & Advanced Hooks 4-5 July

Memoization: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback – understand when and why to use them, common pitfalls.
useRef: Direct DOM access, mutable values across renders.
Custom Hooks: Design principles, reusability.
Error Boundaries: How to implement and use them to catch UI errors.
Performance Tools: React DevTools Profiler.
Practice: Identify and fix performance bottlenecks in sample React components. Create a useful custom hook.
Mini-Project Idea: Create a custom useDebounce hook and integrate it into a search input component. Optimize an existing component using React.memo and useCallback.

Days 12-13: State Management (Redux & Alternatives) 6-7 July

Redux Fundamentals: Core principles (single source of truth, immutable state, pure reducers), actions, reducers, store, middleware (Redux Thunk/Saga basics).
Redux Toolkit: Understand why it's the modern standard for Redux development and how it simplifies common patterns (createSlice, createAsyncThunk).
Comparison: Redux vs. Context API vs. custom hooks – when to choose each for different scenarios.
Practice: Implement a small feature using Redux Toolkit. Trace data flow in a Redux application.
Mini-Project Idea: Build a small "Shopping Cart" or "User Management" application using Redux Toolkit for state management. Focus on adding/removing items, updating quantities.

Day 14: Review & React Coding Challenges 8 July
Review all concepts from Week 2.
Solve 3-4 medium-level React-specific coding challenges (e.g., build a reusable modal, an autocomplete component, a custom hook for form validation).
