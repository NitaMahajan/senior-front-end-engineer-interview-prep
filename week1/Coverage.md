Week 1: JavaScript Fundamentals & Advanced Concepts

Days 1-2: Core JavaScript Mechanics: 25-26 June

Variables & Scoping: var, let, const, block scope, function scope.✅
this Keyword: Understanding this binding (implicit, explicit, new, lexical). ✅
Closures: Deep dive into how they work and common use cases (e.g., private variables, currying). ✅
Hoisting: Variable and function hoisting. ✅
Practice: Write code snippets to demonstrate this binding, closures. Solve questions like "What will be the output?" for various scope and this scenarios. ✅
Mini-Project Idea: Create a simple counter or timer function using closures to maintain state.✅

Days 3-4: Asynchronous JavaScript & Event Loop 27-28 June

Callbacks: Pros and cons.✅
Promises: States, chaining, Promise.all, Promise.race, Promise.any, Promise.allSettled. Error handling.✅
async/await: How it simplifies asynchronous code, error handling (try...catch).✅
Event Loop: Microtasks vs. Macrotasks. Understand the execution order.✅
Practice: Implement a simple data fetching mechanism using Promises and async/await. Trace event loop execution for various code snippets.✅
Mini-Project Idea: Build a simple data fetching utility that simulates an API call with delays, using Promises and then converting it to async/await.✅

Days 5-6: ES6+ Features & OOP in JS 29-30 June

ES6+: Destructuring, spread/rest operators, template literals, arrow functions, default parameters, iterators/generators.✅
OOP: Prototypes, prototypal inheritance (Object.create, __proto__), constructor functions, ES6 classes (syntactic sugar).✅
Functional Programming Basics: Immutability, pure functions, higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce).✅
Practice: Refactor old-style JS functions to use arrow functions, destructuring. Implement a simple inheritance chain.✅
Mini-Project Idea: Create a simple custom Array method (e.g., a polyfill for map or filter) or a basic class hierarchy (e.g., Animal -> Dog/Cat).✅

Day 7: Review & Advanced JS Coding Challenges 1 July
Review all concepts learned this week.
Solve 3-4 medium-level JavaScript coding challenges. Focus on questions that test your understanding of closures✅, this✅, async patterns (e.g., implement debounce✅/throttle✅, polyfill bind✅, create a memoization function✅).
